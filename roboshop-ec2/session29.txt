Modules development
----------------------------
DRY --> Don't repeat yourself

code reuse, no need to write infrs code for every project from the scratch

ec2.tf
variables.tf

module "" {
  
}

Here ec2 is the module and roboshopec2 is the user

we can use custom modules for our organization or we can use community available modules.


1. module developer --> who develops modules
2. module user ---> who consumes modules
